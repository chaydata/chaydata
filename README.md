## Hi, my name is Chris, and welcome to my GitHub Profile! 👋
I use my GitHub all the time at work, but it's all private and behind-the-scenes! I also use GitHub for personal projects, which tend to be more public, so that is the focus here.  

### Text adventure scripts
I share some of my text adventure scripts here in case they are a useful reference for others (e.g. to answer "how did he do XYZ in the game?")

### Telefang transcription project
Music data and resources from the the GameBoy game Telefang

### Game dev (private)
This section is just for me and collaborators, for easy access to our repos where we develop games behind the scenes 😛 These are probably mostly private (not public) repos. If you want to check out the actual games, just go to my [itch.io](https://eldritchrenaissancecake.itch.io/) and they should be there (or not yet released).
